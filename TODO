TODO:
Mika: VITUN TARKEA - data structures for level information (terrain, enemies, objects and what-not)

Mika: VITUN TARKEA - automatic level generator (doesnt need to be great, just needs to work..)

Mika: VITUN TARKEA - Collision detection (the constraints for this problem are still open)

      OLISI KIVA   - function to class Model, which returns the current height of the model (eg. the y-value of the lowest position of the model in its local context)
      
      OLISI KIVA   - Animator. A separate program that allows the creation of animations for models.
            
      OLISI KIVA   - Apply gravity and model other significant forces (units can be thrown around by explosions, heavy collisions, etc..) (maybe Ossi can do some magic here.. :D)
