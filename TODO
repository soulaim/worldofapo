TODO:
      OLISI KIVA   - Better minimap. Convey player info (local player, team id, hitpoints, etc).
      
      OLISI KIVA   - Transfer 

      OLISI KIVA   - Art content (sounds, music, models, animations, textures, effects..)

      OLISI KIVA   - Sound system

      OLISI KIVA   - Minimap

      OLISI KIVA   - Weapon definitions

      OLISI KIVA   - Ability to cast light in areas (flares)

MIKA  VITUN TARKEA - DEVOURING does not cause death, nor do sufficient damage. FIX.
      
      OLISI KIVA   - Better handling of debug messages during gameplay.
      
      OLISI KIVA   - Smarter enemy behaviour
      VITUN TARKEA - NPC behaviour.

!!    VITUN TARKEA - Server crashes with the following events: Client connect, client disconnect, client connect, client disconnect. Find out why, and fix.

      VITUN TARKEA - Connecting to active games results in randomly getting out of sync. Why? (if starts in sync, stays in sync)

      VITUN TARKEA - FIX MESSAGE HANDLING AND THE UNIT INFORMATION CONTAINER

      VITUN TARKEA - data structures for level information (terrain, enemies, objects and what-not)

Mika  VITUN TARKEA - automatic level generator (doesnt need to be great, just needs to work..)

      OLISI KIVA   - Smart object to object collision detection. ( meaning better than O(n^2) )

      VITUN TARKEA - Game mechanics.
      
      OLISI KIVA   - function to class Model, which returns the current height of the model (eg. the y-value of the lowest position of the model in its local context)
      
      OLISI KIVA   - Animator. A separate program that allows the creation of animations for models.
      
      OLISI KIVA   - model significant forces (units can be thrown around by explosions, heavy collisions, etc..) (maybe Ossi can do some magic here.. :D)
            
Mika/Sami  VITUN TARKEA - Menu UI & Menu IO
