TODO:
      OLISI KIVA   - Player informations (name, id, other stuff?)

      VITUN TARKEA - FIX MESSAGE HANDLING AND THE UNIT INFORMATION CONTAINER

      VITUN TARKEA - data structures for level information (terrain, enemies, objects and what-not)

Mika  VITUN TARKEA - automatic level generator (doesnt need to be great, just needs to work..)

      VITUN TARKEA - Collision detection (the constraints for this problem are still open)

      VITUN TARKEA - Game mechanics.

      VITUN TARKEA - NPC behaviour.
      
      OLISI KIVA   - function to class Model, which returns the current height of the model (eg. the y-value of the lowest position of the model in its local context)
      
      OLISI KIVA   - Animator. A separate program that allows the creation of animations for models.
      
      OLISI KIVA   - model significant forces (units can be thrown around by explosions, heavy collisions, etc..) (maybe Ossi can do some magic here.. :D)
      
Mika  OLISI KIVA   - Handle disconnecting players (currently crashes server :D)
      
Mika  VITUN TARKEA - Menu UI & Menu IO
      
Mika  OLISI KIVA   - Apply some basic physics (velocity, acceleration, gravity) -- Jumping should maybe not be so OP

Mika  OLISI KIVA   - Apply a less idiotic model for moving up & down hills
      
Mika  VITUN TARKEA - Print text on screen

      MELKO VITUN TARKEA - Centralize IO checks.
      
      VITUN TARKEA - Mechanism(s) for sending other than Player Input messages across the network (chat, pause, ..)
      
      
DONE
1.10. Mika: Use server name instead of IP address for connecting
30.9. Mika: Introduced some camera control and frustum culling.
29.9. Mika: Additional networking code. Now possible to join games which have already started (although player disconnects crash the server).
26.9. Mika: organize files. src for source files. data for data files etc. New makefile.
24.9. Mika: networking. all commands with game effects must go through the network code.
23.9. Mika: Fixed point representation for all game world data (for visual information this is not relevant)
23.9. Mika: user IO class
xx.x. Mika: Data structure for models (Model)
xx.x. Mika: Create a sample model ("model.bones")
xx.x. Mika: Create a sample set of object parts ("parts.dat")
xx.x. Mika: Representation of animations (Animation)
xx.x. Mika: Draw a model (Graphics::drawPartsRecursive())
23.9. Juho: Make Git Work :), and make me learn to do something useful ou god vim (:D)
