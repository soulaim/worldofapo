TODO
   - function to class Model, which returns the current height of the model (eg. the y-value of the lowest position of the model in its local context)
   - Fixed point representation for all game world data (for visual information this is not relevant)
   - user IO class
   - networking. all commands with game effects must go through the network code
   - Animator. A separate program that allows the creation of animations for models.
   - Collision detection (the constraints for this problem are still open)
   - Apply gravity and model other significant forces (units can be thrown around by explosions, heavy collisions, etc..) (maybe Ossi can do some magic here.. :D)
   - Create a ground for the game world, with textures and height informations
   - organize files. src for source files. data for data files etc.
DONE
Mika: Data structure for models (Model)
Mika: Create a sample model ("model.bones")
Mika: Create a sample set of object parts ("parts.dat")
